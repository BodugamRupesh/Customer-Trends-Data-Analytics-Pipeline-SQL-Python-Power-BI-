## ✅ Project Workflow

### 1) Data Preparation & Modeling (Python)
Performed end-to-end data cleaning and transformation in Python.

**Key Steps:**
- Loaded dataset using `pandas`
- Performed initial exploration using `df.info()` and `df.describe()`
- Handled missing values in `review_rating`
  - Imputed using **median rating per product category**
- Standardized column names using **snake_case**
- Feature Engineering:
  - Created `age_group` using binning
  - Created `purchase_frequency_days`
- Consistency check:
  - Verified redundancy between `discount_applied` and `promo_code_used`
  - Dropped `promo_code_used`
- Integrated cleaned dataset with PostgreSQL using a Python database connector and loaded the final table for SQL analysis
